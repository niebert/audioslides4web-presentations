# AudioSlides4Web-Presentations
This repositories contain example presentations generated with audioslides4web, e.g. PDF slides that are converted into webbased presentations with audio comments and audio comments are recorded with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

## Create an AudioSlides4Web Presentation
If you want to create an AudioSlides4Web presentation then you can start with PDF of the slides in **landscape format** or a list of images. The images should have a number in the filename e.g. `img5.png` for slide 5 or `slide14.jpg` for slide 14. Keep in mind that the slide enumeration starts with 0 and slide 0 is the title slide.

Record the audio comments e.g. with  [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) store the file with a number in the file name. The number in the file name should match with the corresponding slide - `audio5.mp3` for audio comment for slide 5 or `comment14.ogg` for audio comments of slide 14. If you want to create an audio comment for the title slide name the audio comment e.g. `audio0.mp3` with zero in the filename.

**REMARK:** Avoid other numbers in the filenames e.g. `comment2020audio5.mp3` or `mydocu2020slide5.png`.
